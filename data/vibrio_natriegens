The literature describes an array of protocols for cultivating Vibrio natriegens. For preservation and preculture, one study used LB medium supplemented with a 20g/L glycerol solution for storage (1.5mL aliquots) and a modified LB for preculture that contains 10g/L tryptone, 5g/L yeast extract, and 20g/L NaCl (pH 7) (1.1). High‐cell‐density cultivation was achieved by a modified M9 medium supplemented with 20g/L NaCl, 12g/L glucose, 8.5g/L Na2HPO4·2H2O, 3g/L KH2PO4, 1g/L NH4Cl, 0.74g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 5g/L (NH4)2SO4, and an appropriate trace element solution (1.1).

Other protocols employ modified Wilms-MOPS medium (per liter): 15 g NaCl, 250 mL main salt solution (27.92g/L ammonium sulfate, 12g/L dipotassium phosphate, 8g/L disodium sulfate, pH 7.5), 40mL of a 550g/L glucose stock, 10mL of a 50g/L MgSO4 stock, 1mL of a 10g/L thiamin solution, 1mL trace element solution, and 1mL carbenicillin (2.1). Cultivation in BHI medium involves using 37g/L BHI with 15g/L NaCl (also supported by a report recommending 15g/L sea salts for BHI) (3.1, 4.1).

LB3 medium is prepared by adding 20 g NaCl to 25 g LB Broth to yield a 3% (w/v) NaCl concentration (5.1). In agar formulations, LB agar comprises 10g/L tryptone, 5g/L yeast extract, 10g/L NaCl, and 15g/L agar, while nutrient agar and M9 minimal agar are formulated with defined amounts of peptone, yeast extract, Na2HPO4 (12.8g/L), KH2PO4 (3g/L), NaCl (0.5g/L), NH4Cl (1g/L), a defined glucose solution, MgSO4, and CaCl2 (6.1). Additionally, TBV2 medium (12g/L tryptone, 24g/L yeast extract, 15g/L NaCl, 0.5% v/v glycerol, 2.31g/L KH2PO4, 16.43g/L K2HPO4·3H2O) and ZYM-based media (with either 1.5% w/v NaCl or 1.5% w/v Instant Ocean, plus ampicillin at 50µg/mL or 5µg/mL during transformation) have been used (7.1, 7.2). A further M9 variant incorporates 15g/L NaCl, 10mL Wolfe’s minerals, 10mL Wolfe’s vitamins, and 0.05g yeast extract per liter (8.1). Some media (VN4) also include Na2HPO4 at 32.8g/L combined with Na2SO4, Na3-citrate, glucose, K2HPO4, MgSO4, Na2-EDTA, FeSO4, CaCl2, MnSO4, ZnSO4, CuSO4, and NiCl2 in specified proportions (1.2).

Vibrio natriegens is thus cultured with precisely defined reagents and amounts that vary according to the desired application.

V. natriegens protocols employ reagents such as tryptone, yeast extract, NaCl (10-20 g/L or higher in specific formulations), defined salts, carbon sources (glucose), vitamins, trace elements, and antibiotics, with amounts tailored to the medium type. The detailed formulations above illustrate the diversity and precision of reagent usage across protocols.
